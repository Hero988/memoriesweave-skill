# MemoriesWeave API

Provides programmatic access to MemoriesWeave — a platform for creating photo memory collections with custom HTML layouts. The agent designs HTML layouts and pushes them to memories. The API provides photos, conversations, workspace context, and people data.

## How to call the API

**ALWAYS use `curl` via the Bash tool.** Do not use WebFetch, fetch(), or any other HTTP client — they fail due to redirects and auth header stripping.

```bash
API="https://grandiose-loris-729.eu-west-1.convex.site/api/v1"
KEY="<user-provided-api-key>"

curl -s "$API/ENDPOINT" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

The user provides their API key (format: `mw_sk_<32hex>`) when requesting this skill.

## Workflow: Creating or editing a memory

Follow these steps in order. Do not skip steps.

### Step 1: Lock the memory FIRST

The VERY FIRST API call must be locking the memory. Do this before gathering context, before reading HTML, before anything else. This shows a loading animation on the user's screen immediately.

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/memories/{memoryId}/lock" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

If creating a new memory (no memory ID yet), lock it immediately after creation.

### Step 2: Gather context

```bash
# Get workspace list
curl -s "$API/workspaces" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"

# Get workspace context (who the people are, relationship info, instructions)
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/context" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"

# Get registered people (names, roles, descriptions)
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/persons" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

### Step 3: Save a "before" snapshot

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/memories/{memoryId}/snapshots" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label": "Before edit — description of planned change"}'
```

### Step 4: Select photos

Use tag filtering as a starting point, then verify with conversation context.

**IMPORTANT: dateFrom and dateTo must be Unix timestamps in milliseconds, NOT date strings.**
Example: July 1, 2025 = `1751328000000`, not `2025-07-01`. Calculate with: `new Date("2025-07-01").getTime()`

```bash
# Filter by tag (e.g. couple, selfie, portrait, traveling)
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/photos?tag=couple&limit=50" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"

# Filter by date range (Unix ms timestamps)
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/photos?dateFrom=1751328000000&dateTo=1754006400000&limit=50" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"

# If user provides a photo ID, fetch it directly
curl -s "$API/photos/{photoId}" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"

# Get conversation context around a photo (what was happening when it was shared)
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/conversations/by-photo/{photoId}" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

**Tags are AI-generated and may be inaccurate.** Use them as a first filter, then verify with conversation context. Do not rely on tags alone.

**Pagination:** If a search doesn't return enough results, check `meta.hasMore` in the response. If `true`, use the `cursor` value to fetch the next batch:

```bash
# First request
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/photos?tag=couple&limit=50" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
# Response includes: "meta": { "cursor": "abc123", "hasMore": true }

# Get next batch using cursor
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/photos?tag=couple&limit=50&cursor=abc123" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

Keep paginating until you find what you need or `hasMore` is `false`.

### Step 5: Choose the correct format

```bash
curl -s "$API/digital-formats" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

Common formats: Phone Wallpaper (1170x2532 iPhone 13, 1320x2868 iPhone 16 Pro Max), Desktop (3840x2160), Social Post (1080x1080).

### Step 5b: VERIFY every photo before using it

Before including ANY photo in your design, you MUST verify it exists and get its actual data by calling:

```bash
curl -s "$API/photos/{photoId}" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

**NEVER fabricate, guess, or construct photo URLs.** Every photo URL must come from an actual API response (`urls.original`, `urls.medium`, or `urls.thumbnail`). If a photo search returns no results for a month, report that to the user — do not invent URLs.

**Verification checklist for every photo:**
1. You received the photo ID from the API (not made up)
2. You called `GET /photos/{photoId}` and got a valid response
3. The `dateTaken` field matches the month you're placing it on
4. The `tags` or photo content matches what you expect (couple/selfie/andrea etc.)
5. The `urls.original` URL is what you're putting in the HTML

If the API returns empty results for a time period, try different search strategies:
- Search by `tag=couple`, `tag=selfie`, `tag=andrea` without date range
- Then filter results by `dateTaken` in your code
- Try broader date ranges
- If truly no photos exist for a month, tell the user

### Step 6: Design HTML and push

Design self-contained HTML with inline styles. For multi-page memories, wrap each page in `<div data-mw-page="N">`.

```bash
curl -s -X PATCH "$API/memories/{memoryId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customHtml": "<div data-mw-page=\"1\" style=\"width:1170px;height:2532px;...\">...</div>"}'
```

When resizing, include `digitalFormat` in the same PATCH:

```bash
curl -s -X PATCH "$API/memories/{memoryId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"customHtml": "...", "digitalFormat": {"category": "phone_wallpaper", "widthPx": 1170, "heightPx": 2532, "outputFormat": "png"}}'
```

### Step 7: Verify ALL images load, then screenshot

Before screenshotting, verify that every image URL in your HTML actually loads. Extract all image URLs from your HTML and spot-check at least 3 by fetching them:

```bash
curl -sI "https://pub-....r2.dev/photos/.../photo.jpg" | head -1
# Should return: HTTP/2 200 (not 404 or 403)
```

If any return 404, you used a fabricated or wrong URL — go back to Step 5b and fix it.

Then take screenshots to verify the design:

```bash
curl -s "https://www.memoriesweave.com/api/screenshot?memoryId={memoryId}&page=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

Optional query params: `widthPx` and `heightPx` to override dimensions (useful for physical products where dimensions come from the product specs, not digitalFormat). Example: `&widthPx=3772&heightPx=5250` for wall calendars.

Returns `{ "data": { "screenshotUrl": "https://..." } }`. Download and view the screenshot. Check that:
- All photos are visible (no broken image icons)
- Photos show the correct people/content
- No duplicate-looking photos on the same page
- Text is readable and correctly positioned
- **Captions match the actual photo they appear under** — you cannot determine which photo is in which position from HTML order alone. You MUST screenshot the page and visually confirm that each caption describes the photo it appears next to. Tags can be misleading (e.g. a "couple selfie on a bridge" might be tagged "coffee date" if they were near a cafe).

**When editing captions:** ALWAYS screenshot the page BEFORE changing any caption text. Look at the screenshot to understand which photo is in position 1, 2, and 3. Then match your caption to what you actually see in the screenshot.

### Step 8: Save an "after" snapshot

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/memories/{memoryId}/snapshots" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label": "After edit — description of what changed"}'
```

### Step 9: Unlock the memory

This removes the loading animation from the user's screen.

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/memories/{memoryId}/unlock" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

**Always unlock when done**, even if an error occurred.

## Creating physical product memories

To create a memory for a physical product (canvas print, poster, calendar, photo book, etc.):

1. Get the product list: `GET /products`
2. Create the memory with `mode: "physical"` and `productId`:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/memories" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"title": "My Canvas Print", "mode": "physical", "productId": "<product_id_from_products_list>"}'
   ```
3. The API automatically creates a pod design session with the correct product dimensions and print specs.
4. Push HTML with `PATCH /memories/{id}` using the product's pixel dimensions (e.g., 9000x7200 for canvas print, 3772x5250 for wall calendar, 3075x2475 for hardcover photo book).
5. The memory can then be ordered through the website's print flow.

### Product response fields

Each product from `GET /products` includes:
- `provider` — `"printful"`, `"blurb"`, or `"gelato"` (determines print fulfillment)
- `bleedMm` — bleed margin in mm (5 for Printful, 3.175 for Blurb)
- `pageCountMin` / `pageCountMax` — valid page range for variable-page products (null for fixed)
- `fileFormat` — `"png"` for Printful products, `"pdf"` for Blurb photo books
- `variants[]` — available size options with per-variant dimensions and pricing

## Product-specific rules

**Wall calendars** MUST always have exactly **14 pages**: cover + 12 months (Jan-Dec) + back page. Each month page needs a correct calendar grid with proper day-of-week starts. Dimensions: `3772x5250px`. Never use duplicate photos across pages. Every photo on relationship months must show the people (not food, scenery, or screenshots).

**Hardcover photo books** (Blurb) have **20-240 pages**. Dimensions: `3075x2475px` (10×8" Standard Landscape with 3.175mm/0.125" bleed at 300 DPI). All pages are interior content pages. Users download the generated PDF and upload to Blurb via "PDF to Book" (blurb.co.uk/pdf-to-book), where they design the cover separately. When generating print files, the system automatically:
- Assembles all pages into a sequential multi-page PDF (interior pages only)
- Pads to even page count if needed (Blurb requirement)
- Also provides individual PNG files + ZIP for proofing

Available sizes: 7×7" (18×18cm), 8×10" (20×25cm), **10×8" (25×20cm, default)**, 12×12" (30×30cm), 13×11" (33×28cm).

Paper: Premium Lustre 148gsm, ImageWrap hardcover, 300 DPI. Pricing in GBP (£28.00 base for 10×8", £0.34/extra page). Never use duplicate photos across pages. Each page should feature unique content and photos from different events.

**Phone wallpapers** support up to 10 pages. Each page is a standalone wallpaper at the device's resolution.

## Bulk export endpoints

For large projects (e.g., 240-page photo books), use the export endpoints to get ALL data in one call.

**CRITICAL — BANDWIDTH WARNING:** Export endpoints read the ENTIRE workspace catalog from the database. Each call costs significant database bandwidth (~5-7 MB for photos, ~1 MB for conversations). You MUST:
1. **Call each export endpoint AT MOST ONCE per session** — never re-fetch what you already have
2. **Cache the results in memory** for the duration of your work — reference the cached data for all subsequent operations
3. **Use `dateFrom`/`dateTo` filters** when you only need a subset (e.g., a single month) to reduce bandwidth
4. **Never call exports in a loop or retry** — if the call succeeds, you have everything

**Photo export** — `GET /workspaces/:wsId/photos/export?dateFrom=TS&dateTo=TS`
- Returns ALL photos (no pagination cap, no 100-item limit)
- Each photo includes a `persons[]` array: `[{id, name, confidence}]` — who is in the photo
- Use `persons` to prioritize photos (e.g., couple together > person alone > other)
- Response: `{ data: [...], meta: { total: N } }`
- **Call once, cache the result, reference from cache for all page designs**

**Conversation export** — `GET /workspaces/:wsId/conversations/export?dateFrom=TS&dateTo=TS`
- Returns ALL conversation chunks (no pagination cap)
- Each chunk includes `text` (full inline message content) AND `textUrl` (fallback URL)
- Response: `{ data: [...], meta: { total: N } }`
- **Call once, cache the result, reference from cache for all page designs**

**Page HTML push** — `PATCH /memories/:id/pages/batch` with `{"pages": [{"pageNumber": N, "html": "..."}, ...]}`
- Push 1-50 pages at once. Even for a single page, always use the batch endpoint.
- Each page is stored as its own ~5KB document in the database (no 1MB field limit)
- Automatically wraps in `<div data-mw-page="N">` if not present
- Creates or replaces each page (upsert by memoryId + pageNumber)
- Pages can be pushed in any order (not necessarily sequential)
- Returns `{ pagesUpserted, totalPages }`
- After writing, automatically syncs the combined HTML to the design session
- `GET /memories/:id/html` automatically concatenates all pages in order
- Screenshots and print file generation load individual pages efficiently

**Delete all pages** — `DELETE /memories/:id/pages`
- Removes all HTML pages for a memory (clean slate for redesigns)
- Returns `{ deletedCount }`

**Set page count** — `PATCH /memories/:id` with `{"pageCount": N}`
- Sets the expected page count on the memory document
- UI and print pipeline use this to know how many pages to expect without scanning

## Photo selection rules

1. **Always check conversation context** around candidate photos before selecting them.
2. **If user provides a photo ID**, use it directly via `GET /photos/{photoId}`.
3. **Prefer** tags: `couple`, `selfie`, `portrait`, `andrea`, `suliman`, `romantic`, `joyful`, `traveling`.
4. **Avoid** tags: `food`, `screenshot`, `meme`, `document`, `sticker`, `illustration` (unless requested).
5. **Prefer portrait orientation** (height > width) for phone wallpapers.
6. Use `urls.original` for high-resolution output, `urls.medium` for web display.
7. **No duplicate or visually similar photos on the same page or across pages.** Check the `fileName` field — it contains a timestamp like `00013190-PHOTO-2025-09-27-19-46-12.jpg`. If two photos have timestamps within **5 minutes** of each other, they are from the same event/session and look nearly identical (e.g. two photobooth strips from the same booth, two selfies at the same spot). When placing multiple photos on the same page, ensure each photo is from a **different date or different event** (timestamps at least 1 hour apart).
8. **Cover and back pages must use unique photos** not used on any month page.
9. **Each month's photos must be from that actual month.** Check the `dateTaken` timestamp. Do not use April photos on the August page.
10. **Use the earliest occurrence of a photo.** Photos in WhatsApp are sometimes resent months later. The `dateTaken` field reflects when the photo was originally taken, NOT when it was shared in the chat. When filtering by date range, a photo taken in July may appear in a December conversation chunk because it was resent. Always use `dateTaken` to determine which month a photo belongs to — if `dateTaken` says July, it goes on the July page, never December, even if it was found in a December conversation search.

## Photo URLs

Each photo has three variants:
- `urls.thumbnail` — 300px wide WebP
- `urls.medium` — 800px wide WebP
- `urls.original` — Full resolution

## Slideshow / Digital Frame Video Export

Render multi-page digital memories as MP4 videos with Ken Burns effects and transitions. Only available for digital memories (not physical products). The rendered video includes AI quality review via Gemini.

### Workflow

1. Design a multi-page memory first (at least 2 pages with `data-mw-page`)
2. Configure the slideshow:
   ```bash
   curl -s -X POST "$API/memories/{memoryId}/slideshow/render" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
       "resolution": "1920x1080",
       "reviewModel": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview",
       "slides": [
         {"page": 1, "durationSeconds": 6, "kenBurns": {"direction": "zoom_in_center", "intensity": 0.3}, "transition": {"type": "crossfade", "durationSeconds": 1.5}},
         {"page": 2, "durationSeconds": 5, "kenBurns": {"direction": "pan_left", "intensity": 0.5}, "transition": {"type": "fade_black", "durationSeconds": 2.0}},
         {"page": 3, "durationSeconds": 7, "kenBurns": {"direction": "zoom_out_center", "intensity": 0.3}}
       ]
     }'
   ```
3. Poll for completion:
   ```bash
   curl -s "$API/memories/{memoryId}/slideshow" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
   ```
4. When status is "completed", download the video from the `videoUrl` field
5. Read the `reviewFeedback` for quality assessment
6. If issues are identified, adjust the config and re-render

## Conversation Summaries

Warm, factual summaries of WhatsApp conversations at any granularity — by day, by month, by year, or for a custom date range. Suitable for scrapbooks, photo books, and memory collections.

### Summary types

| Type | User says | What it produces |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Day summaries** | "Create day summaries from April to January" | One summary per day — what happened that specific day |
| **Month summaries** | "Summarise each month from April to January" | One summary per month — the highlights, milestones, and themes of that month |
| **Year summary** | "Give me a year summary of our conversations" | One overall summary — the full story arc across the entire period |
| **Custom range** | "Summarise what happened between June 10 and June 20" | One summary covering that specific date range |

Each summary has: `title` (2-3 words), `titleLine2` (1-3 words), `summary` (length varies by type), `startDate`, `endDate`, `periodKey`, `status`.

### Two options for getting summaries

The user chooses which approach they want:

---

#### Option A: Fetch existing summaries from the website (recommended)

If the user has already generated summaries on memoriesweave.com (via the website's + Generate button), fetch them directly from the API. This is faster, cheaper, and the summaries have already been AI-verified.

The user tells you which summaries to use by either:
- Giving you a **volume ID** (copied from the website UI — e.g., `vol:jd7a83kxyz...`): "Use the summaries from this volume: vol:jd7a83kxyz..."
- Specifying a **type and date range**: "Get my day summaries from April to June"
- Saying **"use existing summaries"** or **"fetch my summaries"**

**How to fetch:**

```bash
# 1. Check what summaries exist
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/summaries/counts" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
# Returns: {"data": {"day": 25, "week": 0, "month": 3, "year": 1, ...}}

# 2. List volumes (generation batches) — shows what was generated and when
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/summaries/volumes" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
# Returns volumes with: volumeNumber, periodType, dateFrom, dateTo, status, completedPeriods, totalPeriods

# 3a. Get all summaries from a specific volume
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/summaries/volumes/{volumeId}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
# Returns volume details + all its summaries

# 3b. OR list summaries by type + optional date range
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/summaries?type=day&dateFrom=2025-04-06&dateTo=2025-04-30" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
# Returns array of summaries matching the filter

# 3c. OR bulk export ALL summaries of a type
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/summaries/export?type=day" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
# Returns all summaries (no pagination cap) — best for large sets

# 4. Get a single summary by periodKey
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/summaries/day:2025-04-06" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
# Returns: {title, titleLine2, summary, startDate, endDate, status, ...}
```

Each summary object looks like:
```json
{
  "periodKey": "day:2025-04-06",
  "periodType": "day",
  "startDate": "2025-04-06",
  "endDate": "2025-04-06",
  "title": "First Chats",
  "titleLine2": "Cat Cafe Plans",
  "summary": "Their very first conversation — both had never dated before...",
  "status": "verified",
  "messageCount": 163,
  "verificationPasses": 2
}
```

---

#### Option B: Generate summaries manually (agent does the work)

If the user hasn't generated summaries on the website yet, or wants the agent to create them from scratch by reading the raw conversations. This is slower but doesn't require any prior setup on the website.

The user says things like: "Create day summaries for me from April to January", "Write summaries yourself from the conversations"

**Step 1: Export conversations to local .txt files**

```bash
# Get all conversations with inline text
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/conversations/export?dateFrom=TS&dateTo=TS" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" > convos_export.json
```

Then group by date into monthly .txt files for easy reading:
```javascript
// Group conversation text by date, save as monthly .txt files
// Each date section starts with: ========== YYYY-MM-DD ==========
// Contains the FULL conversation text for that day (no truncation)
```

Save as `convos_YYYY-MM.txt` (e.g., `convos_2025-04.txt`). Include ALL message text — never truncate.

**Step 2: Generate summaries by reading conversations**

Read the actual conversation text and write summaries. Each summary has:
- `title`: First line of a decorative title (2-3 words, e.g., "Sweet Mornings")
- `titleLine2`: Second line (1-3 words, e.g., "& Missing You")
- `summary`: Description of what ACTUALLY happened. Must be:
  - Written in **third person** (use actual names, not "I" or "you")
  - **Specific** — reference real places, events, quotes from the conversation
  - **Factual** — only include what is explicitly stated in messages
  - **Warm and nostalgic** — like a scrapbook caption looking back

**For day summaries:** Process one day at a time. Use parallel agents (one per 2 months) for speed. Each agent reads the .txt files and saves to a separate JSON file (e.g., `summaries_apr_may.json`). Summary length: 1-3 sentences.

**For month summaries:** Read ALL conversations for that month. Identify the key events, milestones, recurring themes, and emotional arc. Summary length: 3-5 sentences. Title should capture the month's main theme (e.g., "The Month We" / "Fell in Love" or "Exams &" / "Adventures").

**For year summaries:** Read conversations across the full period (or use the day/month summaries as input). Tell the complete story arc — how it started, key milestones, how the relationship evolved. Summary length: 5-10 sentences. Title should capture the overall journey (e.g., "Our Story" / "300 Days").

**For custom range summaries:** Read conversations in the specified range. Length proportional to the range — a few days gets 1-3 sentences, a few weeks gets 3-5.

**Step 3: Verify summaries (CRITICAL — run at least 2 passes)**

Launch verification agents that re-read each day's conversation and check every claim in the summary:

1. Is every fact directly supported by a message?
2. Is every event on the correct date? (Messages after midnight = next day)
3. Is anything fabricated, assumed, or embellished?
4. Is anything from an adjacent day bleeding in?
5. Who said what — correct attribution?
6. "Planned" vs "actually happened" accurately distinguished?

Common AI errors to watch for (from experience with 94 corrections across 5 passes):
- **Date bleeding** (~30%): Messages after midnight attributed to wrong day
- **Fabricated details** (~20%): AI inventing names, places, events not in text
- **Planned vs happened** (~15%): Saying they did something they only discussed
- **Wrong attribution** (~10%): Mixing up who said what
- **Adjacent day bleed** (~10%): Details from wrong day
- **Embellishment** (~10%): Adding unsupported adjectives/details
- **Wrong specifics** (~5%): Incorrect amounts, times, place names

Run multiple verification passes until a pass comes back with 0-2 fixes. Minimum 2 passes recommended, 3-5 for print-quality output.

**Step 4: Merge and save**

Merge all per-month files into a single `day_summaries.json`. Generate a review HTML for the user to browse.

**Step 5: Create review HTML**

Build a browsable HTML file showing all summaries so the user can review before applying:
```html
<!-- Each day shown as a card with date, title, and summary -->
<div class="day">
  <div class="day-date">2025-04-12</div>
  <div class="day-title">The First Date</div>
  <div class="day-summary">Their very first date! Both nervous, both excited...</div>
</div>
```

### Using day summaries in photo books

When integrating summaries into photo book pages, render them as **Polaroid Story Cards** — a Polaroid-shaped card with:
- Watercolor wash background (layered CSS radial gradients)
- "this day was about" header in small Playfair Display caps
- Big decorative title in Dancing Script (line 1 in espresso, line 2 in rose)
- Gold divider (line + ✦ + line)
- Summary text in Caveat cursive, centered
- Handwritten caption at Polaroid bottom

For **single-day pages**: caption says "a day to remember"
For **multi-day pages**: each day gets its own card with "our 3rd May" / "our 4th May" captions

## Blurb BookWright Photo Book Export

When the user wants to convert a photo book memory HTML into a physical Blurb hardcover book, follow this automated pipeline. The user just says "make this into a photobook" and we handle everything.

### Blurb Book Specifications (exact settings used for ordering)

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| **Cover type** | Hardcover, ImageWrap |
| **Size** | Standard Landscape, 10×8 in (25×20 cm) |
| **Paper** | Premium Paper, lustre finish (148gsm Premium Lustre) |
| **Cover finish** | Matte |
| **Blurb logo** | Custom Logo Upgrade (remove Blurb logo page) |
| **End sheets** | Standard Mid-Grey |
| **Page count** | 20-240 (must be even) |
| **Page dimensions** | 3075×2475px (10.25×8.25" at 300 DPI, includes bleed) |
| **SKU** | `PHBK-1000x0800-IW-PPRLS` |
| **Pricing** | From £28.00 base + £0.34/extra page (before discounts) |
| **Product page** | https://www.blurb.co.uk/photo-books/imagewrap-hardcover-photo-book |

### Prerequisites

- Node.js + Playwright (`npx playwright install`)
- Python 3 (built-in `sqlite3`, `Pillow` for image processing)
- Blurb BookWright desktop app installed (download from blurb.co.uk)
- A BookWright project created with: Size 25×20cm, Premium Lustre, Matte, 20 pages starting count

### Critical: Print Safe Zone

BookWright's `autolayout="fill"` crops **94px from each side** of 3075px-wide images. The print trim removes additional margin. To prevent ANY content from being clipped, **wrap all page content in a `scale(0.91)` transform** before rendering:

```python
# For each page div in the HTML, insert a wrapper after the opening tag:
wrapper = '<div style="position:absolute;inset:0;transform:scale(0.91);transform-origin:center center;">'
# Close the wrapper before the page's closing </div>
```

This scales all content to 91% and centers it, creating ~138px of safe margin on all edges. This is the ONLY reliable method — shifting individual CSS properties misses elements.

### Automated Pipeline

**Step 1: Fetch the HTML from the memory**

```bash
# The API returns a URL to the HTML file, then download it
curl -s "$API/memories/{memoryId}/html" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
# Response: {"data":{"type":"url","url":"https://...convex.cloud/api/storage/..."}}
# Download the actual HTML from the storage URL
curl -s "STORAGE_URL" > photobook.html
```

**Step 2: Apply print safe zone + upgrade image URLs**

```python
# 1. Wrap ALL page content in scale(0.91) wrapper for print safety
# 2. Replace -thumb.webp and -medium.webp with .jpg for print quality
# 3. If page 1 is a title page matching the cover, remove it (cover handles it)
```

**Step 3: Pre-download all images locally**

Images from the R2 CDN can timeout during rendering. Download ALL unique image URLs to a local folder first, then replace CDN URLs with `file://` paths in the HTML:

```javascript
// Extract all unique CDN URLs from HTML
// Download each to local-images/ folder (parallel batches of 20)
// IMPORTANT: Some -thumb.webp files don't have .jpg equivalents
// If a downloaded file is HTML (error page), re-download as original .webp format
// Replace all CDN URLs in HTML with file:// local paths
```

**Step 4: Render each page as a high-quality JPEG (3075×2475px)**

Use Playwright to screenshot each `data-mw-page` div:
- Wrap the raw HTML in a `<html>` document with Google Fonts `@import`
- Set viewport to 3075×2475, deviceScaleFactor 1
- For each page: show only that page (CSS `.active` class), wait for images to load, screenshot as JPEG quality 95
- Save to `blurb-pages/page_001.jpg` through `page_NNN.jpg`
- Use 3-second timeout per image (local files load instantly)

Fonts to import: Dancing Script, Caveat, Nunito, Playfair Display, Patrick Hand, Lora.

**Step 5: Build the .blurb SQLite file**

The `.blurb` file is a SQLite database with two tables: `ArchiveVersion` (version=4) and `Files` (filepath, filecontent BLOB, filesize, filedate).

Image resolution chain (all three MUST match or images show as "Drag an image here"):
```
bbf2.xml:           <image src="{guid}.jpg"/>           ← GUID only, no path prefix
media_registry.xml: <media guid="{guid}" ext="jpg"/>    ← same GUID, use <media> NOT <image>
Files table:        filepath = "images/{guid}.jpg"      ← WITH "images/" prefix
                    filepath = "thumbnails/{guid}.jpg"   ← WITH "thumbnails/" prefix
```

Key values for the XML layout:
- BookWright page: width=693, height=594 (points at 72 DPI)
- SKU: `PHBK-1000x0800-IW-PPRLS`
- Image fill scale: `594/2475 = 0.24`
- Image x-offset: `-22.5` (centers the slightly-wider image)
- Page count must be even (add blank page at end if odd)
- Schema version: `2.11`, Archive version: `4`
- Include `.version` file with content `4`
- Cover sections: SC, DJ, IW (keep default dimensions, BookWright recalculates for page count)

**Step 6: Add cover images**

Render front and back cover designs as JPEGs and add them to the IW coversheet in the XML. Add the cover image files to both `images/` and `thumbnails/` paths in the Files table, and register them in `media_registry.xml`.

**Step 7: Open in BookWright, review, and order**

1. Open the `.blurb` file in BookWright
2. BookWright recalculates cover/spine dimensions for the page count
3. Click **Review & Upload** — verify no clipping in the print preview
4. Upload and order (check blurb.co.uk/promo for discount codes — Blurb frequently runs 20-30% off)
5. Select: Qty 2, Custom Logo Upgrade (remove Blurb logo), Standard Mid-Grey End Sheets

### Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| "Drag an image here" on all pages | Image resolution chain broken | Ensure `bbf2.xml` src, `media_registry.xml` guid, and `Files.filepath` all use the same GUID |
| Content clipped in print preview | Elements in bleed zone | Apply `scale(0.91)` wrapper to ALL page content |
| Broken image icons (small white rectangles) | CDN images timed out during render | Pre-download ALL images locally, replace URLs with `file://` paths |
| Some `.jpg` downloads are HTML error pages | Original was `-thumb.webp` with no `.jpg` equivalent | Re-download as `.webp` format instead |
| Empty space on pages | Changed page width from 3075 to smaller value | Keep pages at 3075px, use `scale(0.91)` wrapper instead |
| "You forgot to design a cover" warning | No cover images in IW coversheet | Add front/back cover JPEGs to the coversheet XML |

## Workflow: Period in Review

Creates a personalized, scrollable "Period in Review" digital memory — a beautiful dark-themed timeline page with month-by-month insights, real conversation quotes, photos, and highlights. Everything is fact-checked against the actual WhatsApp messages.

### When to use

The user says things like:
- "Create a review of our 10 months together"
- "Make a period in review from April 2025 to January 2026"
- "Create the full review for this workspace"
- "Make a year in review" / "Make our story"

### What the user must specify

The user **must** provide one of:
- **"Full period"** / **"everything"** — use the workspace context's `relationshipInfo` to extract start/end dates automatically
- **Specific dates** — e.g., "from 06/04/2025 to 30/01/2026" (parse as DD/MM/YYYY UK format)

If the user doesn't specify, ask them: *"Would you like the full period review (covering your entire time together), or a review for specific dates?"*

### Step-by-step pipeline

#### 1. Determine the date range

```bash
# Get workspace context to find relationship dates
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/context" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
# Look at relationshipInfo field for start/end dates

# Get persons
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/persons" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

Calculate:
- Number of months covered (this becomes the hero number)
- Number of days between dates (e.g., 299)
- Unix millisecond timestamps for `dateFrom`/`dateTo` in API calls
- Cities they visited TOGETHER (only cities confirmed from conversations — do not assume)

#### 2. Create memory, lock it, save before-snapshot

```bash
curl -s -X POST "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/memories" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title": "Our First N Months — Name1 & Name2", "mode": "digital"}'

curl -s -X POST "$API/memories/{memoryId}/lock" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"

curl -s -X POST "$API/memories/{memoryId}/snapshots" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label": "Before — initial empty memory"}'
```

#### 3. Export ALL data (call each ONCE, cache to disk)

```bash
# Photos — includes persons[] array showing who is in each photo
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/photos/export?dateFrom={ts}&dateTo={ts}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" > /tmp/photos.json

# Conversations — full message text inline
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/conversations/export?dateFrom={ts}&dateTo={ts}" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" > /tmp/convos.json

# Day summaries (if any exist — check counts first)
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/summaries/counts" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
# If day count > 0:
curl -s "$API/workspaces/{wsId}/summaries/export?type=day" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" > /tmp/summaries.json
```

**NEVER re-fetch exports.** Cache locally and reference from cache for all subsequent operations.

#### 4. Select best photos per month

Use parallel agents (one per task) for efficiency. For each month:

**Scoring algorithm:**
| Criteria | Points |
|----------|--------|
| Both persons in `persons[]` array | +200 |
| One person (primary) | +80 |
| Tags: romantic, joyful, traveling, celebration | +15 each |
| Person confidence × 30 | variable |

**Disqualifiers:** tags `food`, `screenshot`, `meme`, `document`, `sticker`, `illustration`

**Deduplication:** Photos with `dateTaken` within 5 minutes = same event. Keep only one.

Select top 3 per month. Ensure variety (different dates/events).

#### 5. Verify every selected photo

```bash
# For each photo ID selected:
curl -s "$API/photos/{photoId}" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

Confirm: exists, `dateTaken` matches intended month, extract `urls.original`.

**NEVER use URLs from the export directly — always verify via individual GET.**

#### 6. Analyze conversations per month

Use parallel agents (one per 2-3 months). For each month, read 4-6 conversation chunks. Extract:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `emoji` | One emoji representing the month's theme |
| `theme` | 2-4 word label (e.g., "Nervous beginnings bloom") |
| `insight` | 1-2 sentence summary, third person, warm/nostalgic, specific |
| `memorableMessage` | **EXACT quote** from conversations (search for literal match) |
| `messageSender` | Who said it |
| `totalMessages` | Sum of `messageCount` across chunks |
| `keyEvent` | Most notable event that actually happened |

**Rules:**
- Only include REAL quotes — must be exact text from a message
- Write insights in third person using actual names
- Reference real places, events, dates
- Distinguish "planned" vs "actually happened"
- If someone retells a past story, do NOT present it as a current event
- If day summaries exist for that month, prefer those over raw conversation reading

#### 7. Fact-check EVERYTHING (mandatory — do not skip)

Launch verification agents that re-read conversation text and check EVERY claim:

| Check | What to look for |
|-------|-----------------|
| Every quote | Search for exact text. Note if it's actually multiple messages merged |
| Every event | Did it actually happen, or was it just discussed? |
| Every date | Correct day? Messages after midnight = next day |
| Every place | Actually mentioned in messages? |
| Past vs present | Is an anecdote being retold, or did it happen this month? |
| Corrections | If someone says "30 min" then corrects to "20", use corrected value |
| Numbers | Calculate day counts mathematically. Don't round 299 to 300 |

**Common fabrication patterns:**
- Date bleeding (~30%): wrong day attribution
- Fabricated details (~20%): inventing names/places/events
- Planned vs happened (~15%): saying they did something they only discussed
- Past stories as current (~10%): retold anecdote framed as recent event

**Minimum 2 verification passes.** Fix all issues before building HTML.

#### 8. Build the HTML

Self-contained HTML with all CSS/JS inline. Wrapped in `<div data-mw-page="1">`.

**Structure:**
1. **Hero** — Big gold number (month count), subtitle in Dancing Script, names line, 5-photo circular strip
2. **Stats bar** — Static values (messages, photos, days, months, cities). **NO count-up animations.**
3. **Month timeline** — Alternating left/right cards. Each has: circular photo, month name + emoji, message count (no sentiment), italic insight, 2 message bubbles, sparkline
4. **Highlights** — 3 cards: best message (chat bubble), journey numbers (label/value rows), best chapter (date + description + stat pills)
5. **Footer** — "Woven with love by MemoriesWeave" + names + days tagline

**CRITICAL iframe rules:**
- **NO IntersectionObserver** — doesn't fire in sandboxed iframes. All elements `opacity: 1` by default
- **NO `requestAnimationFrame` count-ups** — use static text values
- **`setTimeout` works** — use for sparkline draw, confetti timing
- **Web Animations API works** — `element.animate()` for confetti burst
- **Google Fonts via `@import`** in `<style>` tag, not `<link>` tags
- **No sentiment bars** — just message count

**Design system:** Dark theme with MemoriesWeave colors (--bg: #1A1215, --gold: #C5A55A, --dusty-rose: #C4897B). Fonts: Dancing Script, Playfair Display, Lora, Nunito.

**Responsive breakpoints:** 1024px, 900px, 600px, 400px. Timeline goes single-column below 900px. Stats wrap to 2-per-row below 600px.

#### 9. Push, verify, finalize

```bash
# Push HTML
curl -s -X PATCH "$API/memories/{memoryId}/pages/batch" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @/tmp/push_body.json

# Screenshot to verify
curl -s "https://www.memoriesweave.com/api/screenshot?memoryId={memoryId}&page=1" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"

# Save after-snapshot
curl -s -X POST "$API/memories/{memoryId}/snapshots" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"label": "After — complete period review with verified content"}'

# Unlock
curl -s -X POST "$API/memories/{memoryId}/unlock" -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY"
```

#### 10. Give the user the link

```
https://www.memoriesweave.com/workspace/{wsId}/memories/{memoryId}
```
